# MPI-Planet-Renderer
Unity rendering tool for MPI planet simulation.
Log files from ./orbit (having set #define OUTPUT_LOG 1) go into /Resources/Text/ folder to run in-editor.
Program is best run with the scene view tab hidden, as to avoid editor gui errors not present in the exported version, but is useful for moving the camera around to where you want to look.
